Employee Management System optimized for record-keeping and analysis of employee records. Allows users to create and associate employees with user-created departments for reporting needs. User-data is stored and retrieved from a mySQL database while the front end of the program is built in Java using NetBeans IDE. 

Emplo-iFY gives users the ability to easily analyze data through numerous reports. These reports are generated through user commands - on the Reports window - and have functionality such as sort in order to make them clear and coherent.
