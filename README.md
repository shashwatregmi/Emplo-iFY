Employee Management System optimized for record-keeping and analysis of employee records. Allows users to create and associate employees with user-created departments for reporting needs. User-data is stored and retrieved from a mySQL database while the front end of the program is built in Java using NetBeans IDE. 

Emplo-iFY gives users the ability to easily analyze data through numerous reports. These reports are generated through user commands - on the Reports window - and have functionality such as sort in order to make them clear and coherent. Currently the following reports are avaliable:

1) [Department Specific Employee Report](#reports)
2) [Employee Vacation Days Report](#reports)
3) [Employee Type Report (filterable by employee work status)](#reports)
4) [Salary Report (filterable by salary types)](#reports)
5) [Today's Working Employees Report](#reports)
